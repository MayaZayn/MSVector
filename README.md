# MSVector
 
***We created an MSVector class that has similar features of the STL vector..***    

**Made by:**
[***Maya Zain El-Din***](https://github.com/MayaZayn) -
[***Sohaila Abdelazim***](https://github.com/SohailaAbdelazim)     
**Requested by:** *Dr. Mohammed El-Ramly* in Object Oriented Programming course (Assingment 3)

## MSVector supports the following functions/operations of the STL vector:   
- push_back
- pop_back
- erase (with 1 or 2 iterators)
- clear
- insert
- size
- capacity
- resize
- empty
- < and == coparison operators

*We implemented the Big 5 and used exception handling in some functions.*
 
## The goal of this project is to:
* Progress development skills to the level library developers who extend the language with new features. 
*	Learn how to develop a template library class.
*	Learn how C++ vector works and how it is implemented.
